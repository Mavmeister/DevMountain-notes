$q = angulars exclusive promise implemtation.

$scope has access to parents like the closure model in JavaScript.

$q: a different way to handle $http.  use $http when you dont need to manipulate the data, and use
$q when you need to do some manipulation to the data.

$q requests data manually.

//

var deferred = $q.defer();

deferred.resolve(result);

return deferred.promise;

//

return $http.get('http://google.com') //short-hand for the long 'GET' method.
